              <h2>Discouter - Founder</h2>
              <p>
                Discouter is a mobile-based marketing app. Along with my brother
                (the developer), we have created an application to help market
                local businesses in Manly. Currently, we have over 45 businesses
                involved and over 1000 downloads in the Manly area. Discouter
                has been written about in local news sources and is continuing
                to grow at a quick pace.Tasks as the founder have stretched from
                the initial creation and presentation of the idea to researching
                target demographics, establishing the business, creating
                financials to discover appropriate costs that would reach
                break-even and then a forward plan to profit, design of the
                product, and a lot more.
